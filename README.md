### Welcome to the Paid Memberships Pro - Affiliates GitHub Repository

The Lightweight Affiliate Tracking Add On for Paid Memberships Pro creates unique affiliate codes assigned to your affiliate users. When someone visits your site using an affiliate URL (a code is passed to a page as a parameter), the affiliate's cookie is set for the specified number of days. If a cookie containing an affiliate referral code is present after checkout, the order is logged in the affiliate's account.

Affiliates can see a report of their activity by creating a page (optional) with the shortcode [pmpro_affiliates_report]. The admin can view a report of affiliate activity in the admin under Memberships > Affiliates as well as add and manage affiliate codes.
